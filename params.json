{"name":"Adhan","tagline":"High precision prayer time library","body":"# Adhan\r\n*High precision prayer time library*\r\n\r\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/batoulapps/Adhan.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/batoulapps/Adhan)\r\n\r\nAdhan is a well tested and well documented library for calculating Islamic prayer times. All astronomical calculations \r\nare high precision equations directly from the book \r\n[“Astronomical Algorithms” by Jean Meeus](http://www.willbell.com/math/mc1.htm). This book is recommended \r\nby the Astronomical Applications Department of the U.S. Naval Observatory and the Earth System Research Laboratory \r\nof the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.\r\n\r\n## Languages\r\n\r\nAdhan is available for the following languages:\r\n\r\n- Swift [(Usage and examples)](Swift/)\r\n\r\n## Roadmap\r\n\r\nThis is an initial release of the library. The following items are planned:\r\n\r\n- Porting to additional languages\r\n- Comprehensive unit tests for various locations and settings\r\n- Full explanation of the equations used and prayer time calculation\r\n- Suggested method for a country/city\r\n- Convenience methods for determining current prayer/next prayer\r\n\r\n## Contributing\r\n\r\nAdhan is made publicly available to provide a well tested and well documented library for Islamic prayer times to all \r\ndevelopers. We accept feature contributions provided that they are properly documented and include the appropriate \r\nunit tests. We are also looking for contributions in the form of unit tests of of prayer times for different \r\nlocations, we do ask that the source of the comparison values be properly documented.\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\nAdhan is available under the MIT license. See the LICENSE file for more info.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
